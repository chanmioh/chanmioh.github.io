                <p>Hi, my name is Chan Mi Oh (Chanmi Oh) and I've been programming since high school and creating art for as long as I can remember. 
                    Programming has allowed me to explore my interest in brainstorming ideas and designing possible solutions to problems. I also love producing art, particularly simplistic, visually
                    appealing aesthetics.
                    By combining the two, I want to create visually appealing, accessible, and intuitive software, focusing on user interface and design. </p>
                
                <br>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm a third year at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science. 
                    I'm working towards honing my programming abilities while also learning about psychology, hoping to gain some insight on 
                    human cognition to aid me in designing user-friendly software.</p>
                </p>    
                <br>
                <p>In my free time, you can find me drawing on Procreate with my iPad Pro, listening to indie and alternative music, or playing Valorant.</p>
