                <p>Hi! My name is Chan Mi (Chanmi) Oh. I am currently a third year student at Northeastern University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. </p>
                <br>

                <p>As a student, my experience with CS courses has taught me how to develop and design good software. Studying cognitive science has allowed me to explore processes of our mind and how we perceive the world. The opportunity to pursue both majors has given me a perspective I believe to be useful in software well-designed for people. </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>Primarily, I enjoy creating web applications and working with frontend, though I'm also experienced with backend. Overall, my goal is to create software with a purpose that's well-designed with users in mind!</p>
